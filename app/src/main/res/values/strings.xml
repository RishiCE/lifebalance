    <string name="info">Did you know that, as we age, we can no longer hear certain high-pitched noises as well as we did during our youth?
        There are sound frequencies that only young people can hear. This ear-aging process is called presbycusis, and it can begin as
        early as 18. It\'s a result of the natural aging of the cells in our ears, and it\'s unavoidable. However, if you\'ve been good
        to your ears through the years you may be able to detect frequencies that are young for your age.</string>

    <string name="hz8000">8000 hertz (cycles per second): Everyone should be able to hear this frequency. This means you are alive. </string>
    <string name="hz14000">This is 14,400 hertz. This should be difficult for anyone over 40 to hear. There should be a slight click when the sound begins</string>
    <string name="hz18000">Finally, at 18,000 hertz, this sound should be hard to hear no matter WHAT age you are:</string>
    <string name="hz17000">Now this is the sound that separates the men from the boys — literally. At 17,400 hertz, this sound has been used to stop teenagers from loitering at stores.
In other words, if you\'re not a teenager, chances are you won\'t be able to hear this sound.</string>

    <string name="instruction">
        (1) Go to a quite place. There should not be any kind of sound distraction.\n
        (2) Either max out your volume or use a headphone.\n
        (3) Click on start to start the test, hold down the button until you start hearing beep sound for at least 3 seconds.
        (4) The moment you release the button, the test will stop and you will be able to see the result.

    <string name="tip_good">
        Your ear are healthy. You should now focus on your concentration of mind which can help you hear more clearly
    </string>

    <string name="tip_average">
        It\'s okey. Your ears are not as bad as of others. Just avoid using loudspeakers or headphone for long time to maintain your ear healthy
    </string>

    <string name="tip_bad">
        If it\'s because you are old, then it\'s normal. If you aren\'t then it is really a matter of concern. Please consult with a doctor

    <string name="description">An app by which you can test your hearing capacity and understand the human audible spectrum.
        You can get a rough estimate of how your ears are performing with your age Without going to the clinic however,
        this cannot be used as an alternative to ordinary medical tests. If you find your ear unhealthy, you should go for a proper medical test\n\n
